# SPX Dashboard — Session Handoff (row_compute refactor, Steps 1–6 done)

This doc is a self-contained briefing for picking up the row_compute refactor on another machine. Read top to bottom.

## TL;DR

A multi-step refactor extracts the binning computation out of the FastAPI endpoint bodies into a single swappable layer (`app/routers/row_compute.py`). The page-wide `Mode: In-sample | Walk-fwd | Train-test` toggle now drives every binning analysis through one dispatch surface. Steps 1–6 are done and shipped. Step 7 (cleanup of residual forks + dead helpers) is pending.

## The refactor in one paragraph

Pre-refactor, every endpoint had a 2-way `if walk_forward / else` fork plus inline binning math. Adding train/test would have required ~30 new if-branches across 5 endpoints. Now there's one `BinningSpec` (in-sample | walk-forward | train-test), one `make_spec(walk_forward, cutoff_date)` constructor, one `ASSIGNERS` registry, and a handful of free dispatch functions (`filter_by_assignments`, `assign_secondary_bin_stats`, `assign_secondary_buckets`, `secondary_membership`) + one class (`PortfolioVectorBuilder`) that endpoints call. Adding a fourth method (rolling IC, cluster id, anomaly score, etc.) becomes a registry entry plus implementations of each dispatch function — no endpoint surgery.

## The page-wide mode toggle (user-facing)

Top of the OI Analysis page, in the `.sel-bar` row alongside Ticker/Metric/Outcome/From/To: a 3-way `Mode: In-sample | Walk-fwd | Train-test` segmented toggle (`.go-btn`-sized). When `Train-test` is selected, a `Cutoff` date input appears next to the toggle (default `2024-01-01`).

Every binning surface on the page reads from `pageMode` and `cutoffDate`: `/analyze`, All-Ticker Metric Bins, the 2D heatmap (ALL-mode), the heatmap's 1D side bin charts, Multi-Metric Correlation Explorer (mini-bins + result), Secondary Signal Scanner, Secondary Detail, System Portfolio Aggregate. Flipping the toggle triggers `setPageMode(m)` which cascades to every visible fetch site.

Score Matrix is the one binning surface NOT routed through this layer yet — it falls back to in-sample when pageMode is train-test. Flagged in the Step 7 cleanup list.

## Architecture: `app/routers/row_compute.py`

The single source of truth for binning. Contents:

### Contract
- `RowAssignment` dataclass — `{ticker, trade_date, metric_name, metric_value, n_bins, bin, outcome_col, forward_return, dropped_reason}`. `trade_date` is `Any` (preserves asyncpg's `datetime.date`; downstream legacy code does `dd - last_date` on `pair[2]` which needs date objects).

### Spec dataclasses
- `InSampleSpec`, `WalkForwardSpec(warmup=252)`, `TrainTestSpec(cutoff: date, warmup_in_train=252)`. Each has a `kind: Literal[...]` discriminator. `BinningSpec` = union.

### Spec constructor
- `make_spec(walk_forward: bool, cutoff_date: Optional[str]) -> BinningSpec`. Single construction point used by every endpoint. `cutoff_date` wins over `walk_forward`.

### Assigner Protocol + classes
- `RowAssigner` Protocol with `fit`, `assign`, `assign_batch` methods.
- `InSampleAssigner` — wraps `_bucket_pairs_per_ticker` / `_bucket_pairs`. `assign_batch` wraps `_compute_all_bins_fast`.
- `WalkForwardAssigner(warmup=252)` — wraps `_walk_forward_bucket_per_ticker` / `_walk_forward_bucket_pairs`. `assign_batch` wraps `_compute_all_bins_walk_forward`.
- `TrainTestAssigner(cutoff, warmup_in_train=252)` — `fit` builds per-ticker sorted training history from rows with `trade_date < cutoff`. `assign` calls `_bin_for_value(value, frozen_history, n_bins)` for every row. Training-window rows get `bin = K` AND `dropped_reason = "pre_cutoff"` so aggregators skip them while preserving the bin for a future side-by-side view. `assign_batch` delegates to `_compute_all_bins_train_test_fast` (numpy-vectorized via `np.searchsorted`) — without this the batch path on 200K-row × 80-feature data exceeds Cloudflare's 100-second upstream timeout.

### Registry
- `ASSIGNERS: dict[str, type] = {"in_sample": ..., "walk_forward": ..., "train_test": ...}`. Endpoint flow: `spec = make_spec(...); assigner = ASSIGNERS[spec.kind](spec)`.

### Free dispatch functions (used by secondary endpoints + heatmap)
- `filter_by_assignments(rows, spec, primary_metric, selected_primary_bins, is_all, filtered_dates)` → `(filtered_chrono, dropped, universe)`. Primary filter for the four secondary endpoints. Train-test branch excludes `pre_cutoff` rows from the kept set (test-only universe).
- `assign_secondary_bin_stats(spec, rows_chrono, metric, n_bins, outcome_col, is_all)` → `{name, bins, bin_ns}` or `None`. Per-feature stats inside an already-primary-filtered subset.
- `assign_secondary_buckets(spec, rows_chrono, metric, n_bins, outcome_col, is_all)` → `list[list[tuple]]`. Per-bin row-tuple lists for `/secondary-detail`'s downstream equity/yearly/ticker construction.
- `secondary_membership(spec, rows_chrono, metric, selected_bins, n_bins, is_all)` → `np.ndarray` 0/1 vector.

All three train_test branches filter `dropped_reason is None` so training rows don't enter aggregations — the test-window-only semantic ("Option A").

### Portfolio builder
- `PortfolioVectorBuilder(spec, rows, is_all)` — encapsulates the per-system loop for `/portfolios/{pid}/aggregate`. `primary_vector(metric, selected_bins, n_bins)` and `secondary_vector(metric, selected_bins, n_bins, primary_indices)` return 0/1 vectors. Handles the in-sample-vs-walk-forward asymmetry (in-sample bins secondaries on the primary-filtered subset; walk-forward/train-test bins on the full rows then ANDs with the primary mask) and caches per-(metric, n_bins) bin maps across calls. Train-test branch treats `pre_cutoff` rows as bin=None in the cache so they don't fire as system trades.

### Runtime invariants
- `_validate_assignments(assignments, n_bins)` — runs on every `assign()` consumer in dev. Asserts `bin` is `None` or `int in [1, n_bins]`. Kept on permanently.
- `dropped_count_for_mode(spec, assignments) -> int` — mode-aware: 0 for in_sample, count of `"warmup"` for walk_forward, count of `"insufficient_train_history"` for train_test. Used by every response envelope.

## Per-step status

| Step | Migrated | Commit |
|------|----------|--------|
| **1** | `row_compute.py` + `scripts/regression_check.py` (additive dead code) | `9ffc284` |
| **2** | `/analyze` — both ALL and single-ticker branches. Bit-equivalent after two follow-ups (`8f5897b`, `19bfe2f`, `e866848`) that matched legacy bucket-iteration and within-date pair ordering. | `4c70892` + follow-ups |
| **3** | `/global-metric-bins` — Assigners gain `assign_batch` for vectorized multi-feature batch. | `ee92d72` |
| **4** | `/secondary-corr-bins`, `/secondary-correlation`, `/secondary-detail`, `/secondary-scan` — all four routed through `filter_by_assignments` + the three secondary dispatch helpers. `/secondary-detail`'s inline bucket-of-tuples logic moved into `assign_secondary_buckets`. | `7731f61` |
| **5** | `/portfolios/{pid}/aggregate` — per-system loop encapsulated in `PortfolioVectorBuilder` (eliminates 3 `if walk_forward` branches inside the loop). | `080cd99` |
| **5.5** | `/heatmap` ALL-mode (single-ticker stays on `np.percentile` edges by design). | `ce6fc4a` |
| **5.5 continuation** | `/metric-bins` (heatmap side bin charts) + frontend wiring so the heatmap respects pageMode end-to-end. Found via manual UI review: original Step 5.5 migrated `/heatmap`'s 2D grid but missed `/metric-bins`, plus three frontend gaps. | `025ab50` |
| **6** | `TrainTestAssigner` activated end-to-end: every dispatch function gets its train_test branch; every endpoint accepts `cutoff_date`; frontend gets a 3-way toggle + date input. | `e782401` + 3 hotfixes |
| **6 hotfix 1** | TrainTestAssigner preserves original `trade_date` type (not stringified) so `_equity_for_decile` doesn't crash. | `fd93d0c` |
| **6 hotfix 2** | TrainTestAssigner.assign_batch delegates to numpy-vectorized `_compute_all_bins_train_test_fast` (fixes the 524 timeout on `/global-metric-bins`). | `dc0f2ff` |
| **6 Option A** | Test-window-only aggregation: training rows get bin set + `dropped_reason="pre_cutoff"`; all aggregators exclude them. UI label `TEST PERIOD · since YYYY-MM-DD` above the equity curve. Verified via 4 `train_test_check` tests (A/B/C/D all pass). | `3b03d03` |
| Cosmetic | Mode/Cutoff control alignment in the page header (label alignment + button sizing). | `573741d` |

## Train-test semantic (Option A)

Bins are **defined** by training-window data (`trade_date < cutoff`). Aggregations (per-bin avg-ret, win rate, Sharpe, equity curve, trade table, etc.) use **test-window rows only** (`trade_date >= cutoff`). Training rows still carry a bin assignment on the `RowAssignment` dataclass — tagged `dropped_reason="pre_cutoff"` — so a future side-by-side training/test view can iterate the same assignments without re-running the assigner.

For the user-facing question "does the training-defined threshold produce a useful out-of-sample signal?", this is the standard interpretation.

`cutoff > max(trade_date)` degenerates gracefully: every row is training, zero test rows, `assign_batch` returns `[]`, no crash. Covered by `train_test_check` Test D.

## Step 7 cleanup — DONE

All five checklist items resolved across Steps 7e–7k. Final state:

1. **`_sec_score_metrics` dual-signature** — done earlier in Step 7 (filter responsibility moved to caller via `filter_by_assignments`).
2. **Response-envelope forks in the secondary endpoints** — done in Step 7h via the `mode_envelope(spec, ...)` helper in `row_compute.py`. All four secondary endpoints emit a uniform 6-field envelope.
3. **Inline `/heatmap` single-ticker binning + `today_decile`** — `today_decile` migrated in Step 7i (now reads `pairs_decile[-1]` from the active Assigner, fixing a real bug where it could disagree with `trade_calendar[-1].decile`). `/heatmap` single-ticker stays on `np.percentile` edges — deliberate by-design exception (user-visible edge labels in the response).
4. **Dead legacy helpers** — done in Step 7j (`cdaa6f6`). Relocated 13 single-caller helpers from `oi_analysis.py` to `row_compute.py`. `_bucket_pairs` / `_bucket_pairs_per_ticker` / `_walk_forward_thresholds` stay in `oi_analysis.py` because they're still called by view-specific code (yearly_consistency, half-sample, threshold-drift). `oi_signals.py` now imports `_bin_for_value` from `row_compute`.
5. **Score Matrix train-test support** — done in Step 7k (`3bed28f`). Score Matrix's `_tt_bin_matrix` was using `searchsorted side='right'`, putting test values tied with interior training thresholds one or more bins too high. Consolidated onto a new shared primitive `train_test_bin_matrix_per_ticker` in `row_compute.py` with `side='left'` (matching `_compute_all_bins_train_test_fast` / `_bin_for_value` / `TrainTestAssigner`). Correctness verified by both a structural invariance argument and the targeted comparison in `scripts/tt_bin_tie_diff.py`. Affected feature list (pre-fix train-test Score Matrix values to distrust): `pct_up_days_20d` (87% wrong), `max_oi_strike_put` (33%, Δ up to -3), `max_oi_strike_call` (19%, Δ up to -3), `relative_strength_vs_spy_20d` (SPY-only artifact — SPY-vs-SPY is degenerate ~1.0), `pct_from_52w_high` (7%). 114 of 123 features unaffected; in-sample / walk-forward Score Matrix unaffected for all features. Re-run train-test Score Matrix after deploy to flush the contaminated rows. Score Matrix endpoints (`/score-matrix`, `/score-matrix/meta`, `/score-matrix/summary`) added to the regression matrix in `regression_check.py` — closes a blind-spot where the entire endpoint family was previously invisible to capture/diff.

## Verification harness (`scripts/regression_check.py`)

Three modes:

- `capture --tag <name>` — Hits 14+ endpoints against a running dashboard (`--base http://100.76.94.99:8000/api/oi-analysis` for the VPS), writes JSON snapshots into `regression_snapshots/<tag>/`. Has retry-with-backoff for transient VPS hiccups (uvicorn worker respawns from OOM on the 60MB ALL-mode `/analyze` responses). Matrix includes /analyze ×4, /global-metric-bins ×2, /heatmap ×3, secondary-load + secondary-corr-bins chain ×2, portfolios list + aggregate ×2.
- `diff --before X --after Y` — Recursive structural diff with `math.isclose(rel_tol=1e-9)`. Lists of dicts keyed by `(ticker, trade_date)` compare ordering-insensitive.
- `train_test_check` — Four hand-verified train-test correctness tests (A: 10-row small case bins, B: cutoff==max property, C: `pre_cutoff` tagging, D: empty-test-set degeneracy). All four currently PASS.

**Reference baseline** for in-sample/walk-forward bit-equivalence: `regression_snapshots/step3-baseline/` (captured against the VPS at commit `e866848`, post-Step-2 with all the bit-equivalence follow-ups). Every subsequent migration step (3, 4, 5, 5.5) was diffed against this and came back clean except for environmental drift (`cached_at` timestamps on `/global-metric-bins`, FP drift on `/secondary-load` lift values — both 2a-accepted).

Step 7j (`cdaa6f6`) was also diffed against `step3-baseline` (snapshot tag `step7j`). 246 diffs, all explainable as: row-count drift from ~3 weeks of additional ingested `daily_features` rows (~190 diffs), pre-existing Step 7f `cutoff_date` envelope additions (~6), pre-existing Step 7h `mode_envelope` unification (~6), exit prices materializing on trades whose `exit_date` fell between baseline and Step 7j capture (~10), `cached_at` timestamps (2), heatmap edge labels shifting with newer data (~10), two new heatmap matrix variants from Step 5.5. No diff indicates Step 7j broke Assigner behavior — all numeric shifts are row-count-proportional, consistent with structural relocation.

Step 7k (`3bed28f` + `507baa7` + `a16df70`) snapshot tag `step7k` was diffed against `step7j`. 14 of 17 files PASS identical (every Assigner-routed endpoint); 9 score-matrix files baseline themselves (new matrix coverage); 3 files with non-algorithmic diffs (`secondary-corr-bins__wf0` got `cache_miss` due to a uvicorn worker restart between captures; the two `secondary-load` files have fourth-decimal `lift` drifts from ~24 hours of additional `daily_features` data). No collateral damage from the Score Matrix consolidation. `step7k` is the new clean baseline going forward.

## Operational

**VPS**: at Tailscale `100.76.94.99:8000`, from `/spx_analysis_dashboard` via `python run.py`. SSH `root@100.76.94.99` works with key auth from the original machine. The dashboard uses asyncpg+FastAPI+uvicorn (`--reload` mode). uvicorn workers can OOM on the heavy `/analyze` ALL-mode responses (60MB+) and respawn — the regression harness handles this with retry-with-backoff.

**Deploy protocol per step**: commit + push on dev machine → user SSHes to VPS, `git pull`, restart dashboard → user warms cache (loads the OI Analysis page once) → user reports ready → I run capture + diff → user does manual click-through where the plan calls for it (e.g. Step 2's 12-view hard stop).

**Working cadence (in memory)**: one migration step per session, manual review between each, no chaining. See `C:\Users\kroko\.claude\projects\C--Personal-Data-spx-analysis-dashboard\memory\feedback_step_cadence.md` for the user's explicit phrasing.

## Critical files

| File | Role |
|------|------|

## Picking up — concrete first steps on the new machine

1. `cd C:\Personal\Data\spx_analysis_dashboard`
2. `git pull` — latest should be `573741d` (cosmetic alignment fix).
3. If `.venv` is fresh: `python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt` — note `requirements.txt` now explicitly includes `numpy>=1.26.0` (Step 1 added it because the implicit transitive pin from scipy was insufficient).
4. Verify `regression_check.py train_test_check` passes: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\regression_check.py train_test_check`. Expected: A/B/C/D all PASS.
5. The user is currently testing Step 6 Option A in the browser (test-window-only aggregation). If they greenlight, **Step 7 cleanup is next**. Pick one item from the cleanup checklist (`_sec_score_metrics` dual-signature is the most-discussed; envelope unification is the most-pervasive).

## User-context worth knowing

- **124 tickers** in the dataset (a few without 2019 data — affects warmup math for walk-forward).
- Default outcome dropdown is `ret_5d_fwd_oc`. The init() force-selects this via DOM manipulation because Alpine reactivity wasn't reliable for default-selection across browser form-state cache.
- User prefers terse responses, explains the **why** rather than the **what**, reads the diff themselves.
- For exploratory questions, give a recommendation with the main tradeoff and let them redirect.
- User pushes back on descoping ("don't leave follow-up items I'll forget") — when in doubt, finish the item now or add it to the plan's Step 7 cleanup checklist.

## Auto-memory note

**TL;DR for the next session**: Steps 1–6 of the row_compute refactor are done. The page-wide Mode toggle drives every binning surface (Score Matrix excepted, flagged for Step 7). Train-test mode uses test-window-only aggregations per Option A. Currently waiting on the user's manual verification of Step 6 Option A. **Next work item: pick something from the Step 7 cleanup checklist in the plan file.**

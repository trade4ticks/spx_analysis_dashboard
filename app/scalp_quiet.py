Quiet-window metrics: is the level shift small relative to the range I work?

TRADES ONLY. No quotes, anywhere in this file, deliberately.

A 29-share bid is pulled, the next level down becomes the best bid, and the
midpoint moves 19 cents while the stock does not move at all (observed on
EXPE, 30 seconds). On books this thin the midpoint reports order flicker as
price movement, and every quote-derived noise metric inherits it. A trade
price means somebody paid it. That is the entire reason this module exists
alongside the noise family rather than extending it.

--- The hypothesis ---------------------------------------------------------

Not "quiet" in the abstract. Whether the level shift is small RELATIVE to the
range being worked:

    a shift smaller than the capture      a scratch
    a shift about equal to it             one loss in a string of winners
                                          (the old bid becomes the new ask)
    a shift larger than it                a loss

So the quantity is a ratio, and the thresholds 0.5 / 1.0 / 2.0 are those three
regimes. Everything here is in service of computing that ratio honestly.

--- Definitions ------------------------------------------------------------

For a window of trades:

    range   the spread of trade prices in the window, measured TWO ways and
            both stored, in cents and bps:

              iqr      p75 - p25, the middle 50%
              p10p90   p90 - p10, the middle 80%

            The IQR cannot be defined by a stray print, which matters on a
            tape where 91% of trades are odd lots and a single 1-share print
            30 cents away is ordinary. But it may be TIGHTER than the area
            actually worked: 10-15 cents is a routine capture on LLY and 20 in
            good conditions, and if the middle 50% reports less than that the
            metric understates the opportunity it exists to measure.

            Which is right is an empirical question about a specific book, so
            both are computed and compared against remembered sessions. Only
            the IQR feeds the ratio -- see below.
    level   volume-weighted mean trade price.
    shift   |level(this window) - level(previous window)|.
    ratio   shift / IQR, both in cents so the units cancel.

            THE RATIO USES THE IQR, not the p10-p90 span, and therefore so do
            the thresholds, the quiet counts and the episodes. That keeps the
            pre-registered primary fixed while the two range measures are
            compared. If p10p90 wins that comparison the denominator should
            change too -- and that is a second recompute, not a config flip,
            because every count downstream of the ratio moves with it.

RANGE IS REPORTED IN CENTS AS WELL AS BPS, and the cents figure is the one
that matches the constraint. A bps normalisation assumes fixed capital:
shares = capital / price, so profit = capital * range / price. But the binding
constraint is liquidity, not capital -- size is set by what the book absorbs.
Under that constraint profit = range_in_cents * shares_available, and bps
penalises an expensive name for being expensive when the expense is not what
limits the trade. A 15-cent IQR is 15 cents on a $700 name and a $70 one; what
differs is how many shares each will take.

--- The step is part of the definition -------------------------------------

Windows advance by a THIRD OF THEIR OWN LENGTH -- 10s / 20s / 40s for the
30s / 60s / 120s grid. Consecutive windows therefore share two thirds of their
trades at every length, and the shift measures a displacement proportional to
the window rather than a fixed one.

A fixed step would not do that. At 10s a 120s window overlaps by 92%, so
consecutive measurements are nearly identical and the shift is a ten-second
displacement smoothed over two minutes; all three rows would be measuring the
same ten seconds through differently-sized smoothing.

The step is part of the DEFINITION, not a rendering choice: a ratio of 1.0
means something different at a different step, so changing it changes what the
thresholds mean.

--- Windows overlap, so windows are not chances -----------------------------

One quiet patch produces about THREE overlapping quiet windows, since
window/step is 3 at every length. A raw window count is therefore inflated
about threefold -- but by the SAME factor on every row, which a fixed step did
not give (it was 1.5x / 3x / 6x, so the three rows were not comparable to each
other on raw counts at all).

`quiet_episodes` counts maximal runs instead: one quiet patch is one episode
whatever the window length. That is the "separate chances" quantity, and it is
the operational metric. The window counts are kept because they carry duration
information the episode count throws away, not because they are chances.

--- Vendoring --------------------------------------------------------------

This module imports numpy and pandas and NOTHING from scalp. That is a
requirement, not an accident: the live tape tool is a separate project which
must not import from scalp (`rm -rf scalp/` has to leave it standing), so it
vendors this file verbatim and diffs it in its own check_vendored.py. Any
`from scalp import ...` added here silently breaks that copy.

#
# The 15s row was measuring the wrong thing. At a 10-trade guard and Poisson
# arrivals a 15s window needs ~40 trades/min before half its windows qualify,
# and at 30 trades/min only ~5% of window PAIRS are usable -- so its counts
# partly encoded arrival rate rather than quietness, which is the exact failure
# mode 171 metrics were cut to escape. It also sat below where the p10-p90 span
# is trustworthy.
#
# And the question is not about a single trade. It is whether a name is in a
# workable state and will STAY there for several round trips -- a question
# about the next minute or two. The observed case that motivated this: 30
# seconds untradeable followed by 90 seconds good, judged as one two-minute
# decision.
WINDOWS_SEC: tuple[int, ...] = (30, 60, 120)

# THE STEP SCALES WITH THE WINDOW. Each window advances by a third of its own
# length, so every row overlaps its predecessor by two thirds and measures a
# displacement proportional to its own timescale.
#
# A fixed step does not do this. At 10s a 120s window overlaps by 92%,
# consecutive measurements are nearly identical, and the shift is a 10-second
# displacement smoothed over two minutes -- so all three rows would be
# measuring the same ten seconds through differently-sized smoothing.
#
# Two things fall out of the constant ratio, and both are why it is a ratio
# rather than three hand-picked numbers:
#
#   The overlap inflation becomes IDENTICAL across rows. window/step is 3
#   everywhere, so one quiet patch produces about three overlapping windows at
#   every length, where the old fixed step gave 1.5x / 3x / 6x and made the
#   three rows incomparable on raw counts.
#
#   The ratio becomes scale-invariant. On a random walk the shift grows as
#   sqrt(step) and the range as sqrt(window), so the ratio goes as
#   sqrt(step/window) -- constant when the two scale together. Under the old
#   fixed step the median ratio ran 0.50 / 0.32 / 0.18 across the grid, so a
#   single threshold was a stricter test at short windows than at long ones.

# Minimum trades in a window before its IQR is believed.

# median relative error of 33.6% at n=6, 28.8% at n=8, 25.5% at n=10, 20.5% at
# n=15. There is no knee -- it is a smooth 1/sqrt(n) decay -- so this is a
# judgement, not a discovery.
#
# 10, because the thresholds are spaced by factors of two (0.5 / 1.0 / 2.0)
# and a ~25% error in the denominator will not usually carry a ratio across a
# boundary, while at n=6 (34%) it starts to. It also matches
# DEFAULT_FILTERS['min_trades_per_min'] = 10: one minute of the thinnest name
# the universe admits at all.
#
# The cost is coverage on slow names. At a 10-trade guard and Poisson
# arrivals, a 15s window needs ~40 trades/min before half its windows qualify;
# at 30 trades/min only 22% do. That is why the eligible count is stored
# alongside every quiet count -- see quiet_eligible_windows_*.
#
# THE GUARD IS SIZED FOR THE IQR, AND THE p10-p90 SPAN IS EXPOSED AT IT.
# Measured: p10-p90 actually has LOWER sampling error than the IQR at every n
# (18.2% against 25.5% at n=10), because it spans more of the distribution.
# But a single stray print is 10% of a 10-trade window, which lands exactly on
# the p90 boundary and defines it -- one print 30 cents out doubles the span,
# 5.31c to 10.39c. At n=15 the same print is 7% of the sample, inside the
# tail, and the span moves 3.50c to 4.80c; by n=30 it barely moves at all.
#
# The guard is NOT raised for p10p90, because the two measures have to cover
# the same windows or the comparison is between different populations rather
# than between measures. The consequence is an interpretation rule instead:
# on 15s windows, where n sits near the guard, a wide p10p90 may be one odd
# lot rather than a wide market. On 60s windows, where n is typically 30+, it
# is trustworthy.

"""
Equity surface metrics: the column registry (pipeline stage 4).

ONE source of truth. This module defines every column the metrics stage
produces, and three consumers read it:

    lib/metrics_store.py    ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN, from .sql_type
    lib/metrics_compute.py  which values to compute, from .name
    equity_metrics_catalog  the dashboard's metric picker, from everything else

With ~600 columns a hand-written schema and a hardcoded dropdown both rot
immediately, and they rot silently — a renamed column becomes a permanently
NULL column, not an error. Generating all three from this list makes drift
impossible by construction, and metrics_store.check_catalog_drift() asserts it
against information_schema on every run.

WHY THE IV MATRIX IS DENORMALISED
---------------------------------
iv_{t}d_{delta} duplicates data that is already in equity_surface. That is
deliberate. It is the input to every other metric here, so a new skew
definition can be added later and backfilled from these 30 columns without
re-reading a 19x17 surface per snapshot.

WHY TENOR 1 IS ABSENT
---------------------
A 0DTE fit near the close passes the narrow-domain check — its sigma-reach is
large precisely because sigma*sqrt(T) is tiny that close to expiry — and then
corrupts the 1/2/3 DTE buckets as a bracketing endpoint. Observed on SPY
2026-06-05 1545: DTE 1/2/3 all extrapolated, 10-delta IVs 0.168/0.180/0.194
sitting between 0.303 at DTE 0 and 0.240 at DTE 5, non-monotone in both
directions. TENORS starts at 7.

# window will be misread by someone eventually — so the mapping is derived from
# one named constant here, restated in every description, and carried in the
# catalog's formula field.
#

# days (252/12). Everything else is round(0.7 * t):

# regression is a property of the ticker, not an observation of this bucket.
#
# Until 2026-08-25 they were computed from the ROW'S OWN snapshot's history,
# which meant the regression could only fill at a bucket that already had months
# of itself. Every one of these was NULL at every intraday bucket.

#
# Before 2026-08-25 the tenor was hardcoded to 30d and invisible in the name,
# so only the estimation window showed. That is backwards for the reading these
# exist to support: short-dated ATM IV moves FAR more per unit spot move than
# long-dated, and beta_7d typically runs 2-3x beta_90d in magnitude. Sizing a
# 7 DTE short-vega position off a beta estimated on 30-day IV understates the
# vega P&L of a gap by that factor.
#
# The naming rule this settles, across the whole table:
#     {t}d in a name  -> option tenor, retargets
#     a period label  -> estimation window, fixed
# log_ret_d is the one exception, and it is a fixed 1-day quantity, not a tenor.
